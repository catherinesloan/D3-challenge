You'll need to use python -m http.server to run the visualization. This will host the page at localhost:8000 in your web browser.

New error at line 403, says yAxis is not defined. Not sure why I am getting this error as I had previously managed to get the y-axis to change successfully. 
Graph changes successfully when I change x-axis but labels are no longer moving with it. 

To see part 1 of assignment - uncomment out  '<script type="text/javascript" src="assets/js/app.js"></script>' in html file
and comment out bonus source

Need to tidy up comments for both parts.
